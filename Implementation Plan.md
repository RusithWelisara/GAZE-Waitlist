Below is a **FULL COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT** of **[https://gazeplugin.vercel.app/](https://gazeplugin.vercel.app/)** across:

• Product clarity
• Trust & safety
• Conversion
• SEO
• Developer credibility
• Long-term positioning

I’ll go **page by page**, then give you a **global kill list** (things to delete mercilessly).

---

# 0. GLOBAL PROBLEMS (SITE-WIDE)

These hurt everything. Fix these first.

### ❌ Problem 1: You sound like a generic AI tool

Right now, the site reads like:

> “AI helps you code faster”

That’s trash positioning in 2026.

**You are not an AI assistant.
You are a SAFE CODE PATCH ENGINE for Godot.**

If this is not screamed on every page, you lose.

---

### ❌ Problem 2: No explicit safety contract

You *edit source code*. That’s dangerous.

Right now:
• No hard guarantees
• No explicit constraints
• No failure modes explained

To a dev, this feels reckless.

---

### ❌ Problem 3: Audience confusion

You’re half-speaking to:
• beginners
• serious indie devs
• tool hackers
• AI enthusiasts

Pick **ONE primary persona** publicly.

**Recommendation:**
➡️ Public-facing = *Beginner → Intermediate Godot devs*
➡️ Advanced devs will still adopt quietly

---

### ❌ Problem 4: No clear “what happens if it breaks?”

Every dev asks this silently.

You must answer:
• Can I revert?
• Can I inspect?
• Can I reject?
• Can it corrupt my project?

Right now, you don’t.

---

# 1. HOME PAGE AUDIT

## HERO SECTION

### Current issue:

Your hero text is vague and fluffy.

### Replace with something ruthless and concrete:

**BAD (current vibe):**

> AI-powered coding assistant for Godot

**GOOD (what it must become):**

> **Make AI changes to your Godot project — safely, visibly, and reversibly.**

Subheading:

> GAZE generates **reviewable code patches**, not blind edits.
> You see the diff. You approve it. Nothing touches your project without consent.

This instantly differentiates you from Unity Muse, Copilot, etc.

---

### CTA BUTTONS

You need **two** CTAs, not one.

Primary:

> Join the Early Access Waitlist

Secondary:

> See How Safe Patching Works

Right now, you jump straight to signup without trust.

---

## “HOW IT WORKS” SECTION

### Missing clarity

You need a **4-step visual flow**, not paragraphs.

**Required steps:**

1. Select file or scope
2. Describe change in natural language
3. Review generated patch (diff view)
4. Apply or reject

Each step = 1 sentence max.

---

## TRUST SECTION (MISSING)

You need a section titled **“Why This Is Safe”**

Bullet points:
• No silent edits
• No auto-apply
• No cloud execution on your project
• Human-in-the-loop always
• Diff-first architecture

Without this, advanced devs bounce.

---

# 2. DEMO / PRODUCT PAGE

This page should do **90% of the convincing**.

### ❌ Current problem:

You *tell* instead of *show*.

### What must be added:

#### 1. Real Screenshot Breakdown

Use the screenshot you sent me.

Annotate:
• Prompt input
• Diff viewer
• Apply / Reject buttons

Explain each in 1 line.

---

#### 2. Explicit Limitations (THIS BUILDS TRUST)

You MUST say:

> Current limitations:
> • Single-file edits only
> • GDScript only
> • No scene (.tscn) edits yet

This does **not** weaken you.
It makes you believable.

---

#### 3. What GAZE will NEVER do

This is huge.

Example:
• Never auto-apply changes
• Never rewrite entire projects
• Never hide diffs
• Never modify files without explicit approval

Unity Muse will never say this. You should.

---

# 3. WAITLIST PAGE

Right now, your waitlist copy is **low-quality-lead bait**.

You want **fewer but better devs**.

### Rewrite the headline to:

> Early Access for Developers Who Care About Code Safety

Subtext:

> GAZE is not for one-click magic.
> It’s for devs who want AI speed *without losing control*.

---

### Form Changes

Add **ONE qualifying question**:

> What’s your experience level with Godot?

Options:
• Beginner
• Intermediate
• Advanced

This filters noise.

---

### Expectation Setting (CRITICAL)

You MUST say:

> Early access starts after March 2026.
> We’re prioritizing stability over speed.

This prevents “never ships” perception.

---

# 4. FAQ PAGE (OR SECTION) — MUST ADD

You need this even if you don’t have it now.

Required questions:

• Does GAZE send my full project to the cloud?
• Can I undo changes?
• What if the AI makes a mistake?
• Is this like Unity Muse?
• Who is this NOT for?

Short, honest answers only.

---

# 5. SEO AUDIT (SITE-WIDE)

Right now, SEO is weak.

### You need to explicitly target:

• “Godot AI plugin”
• “Godot code assistant”
• “Godot AI coding”
• “AI for Godot developers”

These phrases must appear naturally in:
• H1
• First 100 words
• Meta description

---

### Meta Title Example:

> GAZE — Safe AI Code Patching for Godot Developers

Meta description:

> Reviewable, reversible AI-generated code changes for Godot. No blind edits. No surprises.

---

# 6. NAVIGATION CLEANUP

Your nav should be brutally simple:

• Home
• How It Works
• Demo
• Waitlist
• Docs (even if empty — “Coming Soon”)

Remove anything vague or marketing-heavy.

---

# 7. WHAT TO DELETE MERCILESSLY

Kill these if they exist:

❌ “Revolutionary AI” language
❌ Claims you can’t prove
❌ Comparisons to ChatGPT
❌ Over-promising roadmaps
❌ Anything about “replacing developers”

You are an **augmentation tool**, not a replacement.

---

# 8. FINAL VERDICT

### Is the site “bad”?

No.

### Is it **dangerously under-positioned**?

Yes.

Right now:
• Tech = strong foundation
• Messaging = fragile
• Trust = insufficient
• Differentiation = unclear

Fixing the above turns this from a hobby demo into a **credible pre-product**.
